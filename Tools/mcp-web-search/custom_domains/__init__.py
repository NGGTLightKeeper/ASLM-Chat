# Pass-through custom-domain layer with a single API (see base.py). read_page asks
# match(url) for a handler and calls handler.read(url, ctx). Order matters only in that
# the first matching handler wins; the host tests below do not overlap.
#
# Domains needing only a forced fetch method (twitch/flashscore/sofascore → browser,
# cursor → nextjs_rsc, citilink → browser) are NOT handlers — read_page's generic
# pipeline picks that up from core.profiles.known_domains. Only domains with bespoke
# fetching (terminal APIs) or URL-variant logic (dns-shop) get a handler here.
