"""Persistent, family-keyed browser identity store.

Holds the *earned* browser state — Playwright storageState (cookies + localStorage
+ IndexedDB snapshot) — keyed by engine family, layered over the static personality
from Stage A (UA/platform/locale, which is generated, not stored).

Design (per the warm-browser contract, 2026-06-15):
  * SQLite on disk, modelled on profiles/runtime_profiles.py — the warm daemon is the
    primary writer (idle/recycle checkpoints); engine request builders read locally on
    the hot path with no IPC; MCP-side Set-Cookie capture writes under the same lock.
  * N most-recent *good* generations are kept per family. Memory/age recycle restores
    the latest; a captcha/burn rotates to an older good generation (a poisoned state is
    never the only backup), falling back to None → seed when none remain.
  * Cookies are family-bound: callers ask for a family's cookies and only replay them
    through that family's transport (mixing families is an anti-signal).
