"""Per-engine health tracking with a circuit breaker.

States follow the classic breaker: CLOSED (healthy) → OPEN (cooling down) →
HALF_OPEN (one probe allowed) → CLOSED on success or back to OPEN with
exponential backoff on failure.

Two trigger classes with different cooldowns:
- error (HTTP 4xx/5xx block, timeout, BLOCKED/CHANGED parse): long cooldown;
- degradation (success but thin results or latency spike): short cooldown.

The tracker is in-memory and per-process. EWMA latency uses a fixed alpha —
cheap and good enough to spot a p95-style spike without storing samples.
