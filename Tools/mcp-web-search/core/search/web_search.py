"""Web-search orchestrator: stream → triage → bounded eager parse scheduler.

Wires the live SERP stream to incremental triage and an eager parse scheduler:

    search_stream → source event → triage.ingest (~0.1 ms)
        ├─ PARSE  → fetch/parse starts immediately (bounded slots)
        ├─ QUEUE  → held; consensus votes may upgrade it mid-stream
        └─ SKIP   → dropped

Engine selection is tier-based (low/medium/high) and gated by the per-engine
circuit breaker. Parsing of early winners overlaps the tail of slow engines, so
parse latency hides inside SERP latency.

Process discipline (non-negotiable): every parse task is tracked and cancelled
at the deadline. No fire-and-forget tasks. The persistent warm browser lives in
its own daemon, so a cancelled search never leaves a browser process behind.
