"""Incremental, model-free SERP triage.

Sources are scored the moment they arrive from search_stream. The session decides
per source: parse now, hold in queue, or skip. Consensus votes (the same URL
surfacing from another provider family) re-score an already-seen source and may
upgrade it from the queue into a parse slot.

No registries, no models, no I/O — pure functions over SERP fields, so a decision
costs well under a millisecond. Learned domain trust enters as a point-in-time
ReputationSnapshot the caller loads up front (one DB read per search); per-source
scoring stays a dict lookup.
